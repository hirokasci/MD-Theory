SUBTRACTION IS JUSTICE.The End of the Additive Delusion.Current AI is a dead end. The dogma that "more data and more power equals greater intelligence" is not science—it is a delusion. To understand the sea, you do not drink the entire ocean. You filter it.Intelligence is not Accumulation. It is Filtration.The Core LogicThe movement of the universe is governed by a single, subtractive act:$$\Delta = \Psi - \mathcal{P}(G \oplus C)$$$\Psi$ (Reality): Chaos of raw observational data.$G \oplus C$ (Law & Context): The filter of known patterns and absolute facts.$\Delta$ (Difference): The extracted Truth. The only 0.1% that matters.The AdvantageModern paradigms stack billions of parameters to find a signal. We carve it out.By calculating only the deviation ($\Delta$), we reduce the computational target to nearly zero.This is why a palm-sized Jetson Nano using MD Theory can outperform a massive supercomputer.29 Recursive ProofsThis repository contains 29 demonstrations of "Additive Defeat."Reflex & Stability: Survival without learning. The Rollback mechanism.Extraction of Law: Finding stable orbits in the Three-Body Problem and solving Quantum Gravity by subtracting inconsistencies from chaos.Universal Truth: Terminating historical debates on the Lehman Shock, Fermi Paradox, and the Trolley Problem.The ConvergenceMD Theory is self-recursive. Apply it to itself, and all bias vanishes."Intelligence is the limit of subtraction." There is no other destination.[ >>> EXECUTE: THE ONE NOTEBOOK (Colab) <<< ](https://colab.research.google.com/github/hirokasci/MD-Theory/blob/main/MD_JP _try.ipynb)Author: Hiroka Yoshida (hiroka.sci@gmail.com)License: CC BY 4.0 International.I have handed over the logic.
