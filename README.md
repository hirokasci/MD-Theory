SUBTRACTION IS JUSTICE.The dogma that "more data and more power equals greater intelligence" is a rigid dogma, not science. Intelligence is not accumulation, but filtration—a process governed by the single subtractive act: $\Delta = \Psi - \mathcal{P}(G \oplus C)$. By extracting only the Essential Difference ($\Delta$) from the chaos of Reality, we achieve thermodynamic error minimization where a palm-sized Jetson Nano outperforms massive data centers in energy efficiency per insight. This repository provides 29 recursive proofs of this paradigm shift, from stabilizing N-Body Problems to redefining social dynamics. Intelligence is the limit of subtraction. There is no other destination.>>> EXECUTE THE TRUTH: Experimental Data Index (Google Colab)Author: Hiroka Yoshida (hiroka.sci@gmail.com) | License: CC BY 4.0 International.I have handed over the logic.
