SUBTRACTION IS JUSTICE.Current AI is a dead end; the dogma that "more data and more power equals greater intelligence" is a delusion, not science. To understand the sea, you do not drink the entire ocean—you filter it. Intelligence is not accumulation, but filtration, a process governed by the single subtractive act $$\Delta = \Psi - \mathcal{P}(G \oplus C)$$. By extracting only the 0.1% of "Difference" ($\Delta$) from the chaos of Reality ($\Psi$) through the lens of Law and Context ($G \oplus C$), a palm-sized Jetson Nano inherently outperforms massive supercomputers.This repository provides 29 recursive proofs of this "Additive Defeat"—from finding stable orbits in the Three-Body Problem and solving Quantum Gravity to terminating historical debates on the Lehman Shock and the Fermi Paradox. MD Theory is self-recursive; as you apply it, all bias vanishes until only the Truth remains. Intelligence is the limit of subtraction. There is no other destination.https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZfPrAGM9Ruge0HTzZW2HMnmjbkwh_RZV?usp=sharingAuthor: Hiroka Yoshida (hiroka.sci@gmail.com)License: CC BY 4.0 International.I have handed over the logic.
